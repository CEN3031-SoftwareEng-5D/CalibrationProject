heroku create

This is the default way to push to heroku's site: "git push heroku master". In plain English:
push master branch to the remote heroku (which was created by heroku "create" and is pushed
to heroku's custom site for us, not github). Unfortunately, this syntax doesn't work if 
you want to push any other branch than master. To do this, you need to do:
"git push heroku herokuSetup:master", to push branch herokuSetup. Sometimes you will get
annoying git errors for seemingly no reason. Try to resolve them using this site:

For the most part, I just use "git push --force herokuSetup:master", but seriously make
sure you know what you're doing if you try this. This will forcefully remove everything
on heroku's end and replace it with your branch, ignoring merge conflicts.
